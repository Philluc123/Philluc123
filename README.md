## Its a pleasure to meet you, I'm Philippe (﹙˓ 📟 ˒﹚)

🏫  I'm a Senior majoring in Software Engineering at Florida Gulf Coast University</br>
📲  I've been helping to develop a social media application for almost 2 years!</br>
🌐  I really enjoy Front-End Engineering but have migrated to be more full-stack as of late. I'm passionate about seeing ideas go from wireframes to real tools!</br>
✎𓂃 I also enjoy writing poetry and hope to find the time to create a site to host it all on. Coming Soon!!!
